Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Since this data set was small the time diffrents may not seem an issue for comparison but if we get more and more data then for sure it can cause some problems. By coparing Decision Tree model and SVM which both has almost same running time but SVM turn out to be more accurate. And also it is obvious from the results that Decision Tree is highly dependant on data and in terms of machine learning is overfitted because it gives a 100% accurate result on the trained data it shows that it was not able to generelize the prediction. Therefore my choice is SVM model.   "

    "Support Vector Machine is a classification algorithm which simply means it classify data into diffrent categories (in our case we have two categories \"passed\" and \"not passed\"). But how does this algorithm work? Well, the main goal of this algorithm is to find a seperating vector which will group all the data. For simplicity lets assume that we only have 2 features and when we draw the scatter plot we see that the data are divided to 2 diffrent groups which we can seperate using a line, so in this case our goal is to find the maximum margin between these two group of data. As a result in the future when we have a new data point we simply predict the associated labele to it based on it's location regarding to line. Its good to mention that when we have more features the line changes to a plane which seperates data exactly the same way but in higher dimention."
